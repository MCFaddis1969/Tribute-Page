          <p>I am a noob junior level coder that currently resides in northern New Mexico. I have experience with <strong>HTML</strong>,
            <strong>CSS</strong>,
            and <strong>Javascript</strong> (soon to be getting into <strong>WordPress</strong>). I am currently seeking my first <em>remote</em>position in this field and am very excited to get things rolling. I have completed the <strong>HTML</strong>,
            <strong>CSS</strong>,
            and <strong>JS</strong> courses on <strong>codecademy</strong>. I am very passionate about my family,
            friends,
            the great outdoors,
            music,
            and now coding. I have many skillsets including music theory,
            all-phase construction,
            public speech,
            and engineering (maintenance/electrical).
          </p>
          <p>I am currently focused on refining my coding skills but when I am not coding I enjoy spending time with my friends and family,
            knocking back a few craft ales,
            playing guitar,
            teaching music theory,
            and revising our RV to make it more like what we want. My family and I love to travel around this beautiful nation of ours showing our two little boys the wonders of it. </p>

          <p>I am a 52 year oid husband and father. I recently blew out my knee at my last job and was informed by a friend to take up coding. After doing some research on the career I decided to dive right in. I have been at it for about 3 weeks now (as of November 11, 2021) and have completed HTML | CSS | Beginner Javascript on Codecademy with flying colors. I am seeking remote Junior / Entry level work and have a reliable ISP. I work on a MacBook Pro and an Acer laptop. I am eager and excited to break into the industry with my first job. I am punctual,
            reliable,
            a team player,
            great at problem solving,
            pay very close attention to detail,
            open to new ideas and methods,
            and very easy to get along with. </p>
          <p>Thank you for your time and consideration,
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely,
          </p>

          <h2>Work Experience </h2>
          <h3>Walmart - Taos,
            NM </h3>
          <p><strong>Overnight stocker</strong></p>
          <p><strong>From - To</strong>: September 2021 - October 2021 </p>
          <p>Responsible for stocking the shelves during the overnight shift. I was not at this job very long due to me blowing out my knee and requiring surgery. </p>
          <h3>Anderson Merchandisers - Taos (and surrounding areas),
            NM </h3>
          <p><strong>Territory Service Lead (TSL)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>From - To</strong>: February 2021 - September 2021 </p>
          <p>Started this job as a temporary special projects associate in Northern Arizona. I ended up being promoted to a permanent position with the company servicing one Walmart in Cottonwood,
            AZ,
            three Walmarts in Prescott and Prescott Valley,
            AZ and two Walmarts in Flagstaff,
            AZ. I then requested a transfer to Taos,
            NM where I was promoted to a TSL (Territory Service Lead) and was responsible for a total of 5 stores (Taos, Espanola, Las Vegas and 2 in Santa Fe). Upon leaving,
            due to being offered more hours and money,
            I put in my two weeks notice and helped to train new hires to take over my position and responsibilities. </p>
          <p><em>If you require a more in-depth background of my work history feel free to contact me and I will go into great detail (If I listed all of the different jobs I've had this site would be at least 3 pages long)</em>.
